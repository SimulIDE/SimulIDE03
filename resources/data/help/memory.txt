Ram/Rom:

This component can be configured as Ram or Rom, just adding persistance the data will be saved to circuit file acting as a EEPROM.
You must save the circuit to get data persistance.

It is possible to save memory data to a file and load from file.

It is also configurable in size:

- Address Bits: size in words = 2^Address_Bits.

- Data Bits: size of word in bits.

By default it is a 256 bytes Ram ( 8 address bits, 8 data bits, no persistance ).
