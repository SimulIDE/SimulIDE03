Wave Generator:

Four possible waveforms:
- Sine.
- Saw.
- Triangle
- Square.


It can be turned On/Off with the buttton on the left side.

Change Frequency in "Frequency" property above.

Minimum voltage determined by "Volt Base" property.
Wave amplitude determined by "Voltage" property.

For Square Wave it is possible to set High state width using "Duty Square" property.
Default value is 50%.
