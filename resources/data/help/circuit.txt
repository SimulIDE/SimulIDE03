Circuit:

- Speed: Simulation speed in Steps per Second.

- ReactStep: run Reactive components once every simulation steps.

- NoLinStep: run Non-Linear components once every simulation steps.

- NoLinAcc: Non-Linear components accuracy. Higher is more accurate.

- Show Grid:

- Show Scrollbar:

- Animate: wires will get Red if Volts>2.5, Blue otherwise.

- Font Scale: scale interface font, for example 1,5 = 150%.

- Auto Backup Secs: Time interval in seconds for Circuit to check for changes and save a backup if there are changes.
  Setting time to 0 disables Auto Backup.
