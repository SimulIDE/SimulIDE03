This is the pre-set timer using pic16f689 processor.
This application is driven by interrupts from the timer1 PIC peripgeral module,
interrupts frequiency is 200Hz.
Clock is 4MHz derived from the PICs internal calibrated 8MHz generator with prescaler 2.
Application is writen in C language,
optimized for SDCC free compiler,
piklab IDE was used during development.

How it works:
Right after turn-up it switchs all the loads on
and starts to count-down the preset time (in minuts).
When reachs zero, it switchs loads off, 
blinks with display and beeps with buzzer.
To change the preset time, press KEY_TOGGLE and ajust
value in the blinking position using KEY_UP & KEY_DOWN.
Switch blinking position with KEY_TOGGLE.
Press KEY_OK to store new setting into EEPROM.
